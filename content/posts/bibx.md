# [**bibextract**](https://github.com/CodePurble/bibextract)?
`bibextract` is a small program that I have written. Given a set of LaTeX
sources and a BibTeX file (that acts as a database), it generates a BibTeX file
containing just the ones that are used in those sources, provided they are also
present in the database.

Now if all that is going over your head, in brief,
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a typesetting system for
documents[^1] and [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) is a format used for
reference management, that is used along with LaTeX.

# Why?
I use LaTeX a _lot_. When using LaTeX, it is common to maintain a set of
bibliography entries as BibTeX files for citation. Since I use a
monolithic BibTeX file with all the entries I will ever need, I run into
problems when I need to share my LaTeX project with others. Rather than ship a
~2000 line BibTeX file containing mostly irrelevant entries, it is much better
to ship a BibTeX file only with entries that are used in that project. Now,
it can be easily done for small articles, but for research papers and theses,
it will be quite the task. Manually, one would have to look at the generated
bibliography in the document output and get the required entries from the
database BibTeX. This process can be easily automated given the structured
nature of LaTeX.

# How?
This is accomplished in two stages:
* Extract
* Search and write

## Extraction
We look to the ever-reliable `coreutils`, and Perl-Compatible Regular
Expressions (PCREs) for help here. `grep` can be used to search for `\cite{}`
in the LaTeX sources. `sed` can then be used to extract the BibTeX entry name.
The resulting one-liner is:
```sh
# ext.sh f1.tex
grep -Po '\\cite\{.*?\}' $1 | sed -E 's/\\cite\{(.*)\}/\1/g'
```

* `grep -Po '\\cite\{.*?\}' $1` searches for the text `\cite{}` in the file
  provided as the first argument to the script (`$1`).   E.g. if the file
  contains both `\cite{123}` and `\cite{abc}`, the `grep` command will return:
  ```
  \cite{123}
  \cite{abc}
  ```
  Note the _lazy matching_ that is being done using `?`, causing the `*`
  quantifier to match as **few** instances as possible. This is important as it
  helps deal with edge cases like this line: `\cite{abc}. Foo \textbf{baz}`. If
  lazy matching was not used, `grep` would return the entire line, instead of
  just `\cite{abc}` (why?).

* `sed -E 's/\\cite\{(.*)\}/\1/g'` processes this output by removing the
  unwanted `\cite` and the brackets, leaving us with just what we need: the
  BibTeX entry names. For the discussed example, this command will return:
  ```
  123
  abc
  ```
  I learnt something new about `sed` and sub-expressions while doing this. When
  using `sed`, you can use `\1` through `\9` as references to the corresponding
  matching sub-expression. In our case, the sub-expression is the part within
  the braces in `\cite{}`, indicated by the use of `()` in the regular
  expression.

## Search and write
The rest of the work is done using Python, because I am **_not_** writing a
BibTeX parser in `bash` ðŸ¤£.

I used the
[`python-bibtexparser`](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser)
library for this. The API is straightforward, and offers enough control. It
uses dictionaries to store the parsed BibTeX. Once the database BibTeX has been
read, it can be queried, and matches can be stored in a separate dictionary for
writing. In order to prevent duplicate entries, I used Python `sets` instead of
`dictionaries` directly.
