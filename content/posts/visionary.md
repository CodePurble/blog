In the hyper-connected world of today, most of us are empowered by computers.
Little do we realise that this power was born from decades of work! One of the
key events that accelerated the spread of computers and computing power to the
hands of the masses was the semiconductor revolution. Along with it came the
integrated circuit (IC) (which was preceded by the transistor, of course, but
that's another story). The IC has grown in leaps and bounds since its inception.
[Dr. Gordon Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore) is credited with
coming up with a projection of this growth rate ([Moore's
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)) in terms of the number of
transistors that can be fit into an IC, and boy was he right. What a
**visionary**!

Something that gave me goosebumps is a paper written by Dr. Moore in 1965 for
the _Electronics_ magazine: ["_Cramming more components onto integrated
circuits_"](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/moores-law-electronics.pdf).
What completely blew my mind was that word-for-word, his predictions had come
true!

Let's take a look at a few excerpts from the paper:

> "... at least terminals connected to a central computer-automatic controls for
> automobiles, and portable communications equipment."

The hottest topics of this decade: autonomous transport and mobile phones, both
brought up right in the beginning!

> "... the biggest potential lies in the production of large systems. In
> telephone communications, integrated circuits in digital filters will separate
> channels on multiplex equipment. Integrated circuits will also switch
> telephone circuits and perform data processing."

Signal processing and advanced communication systems, another key area of IC
application.

> ... applying [such] films directly to an active semiconductor substrate.

Not only does he talk about applications, but also on the manufacturing
advances. A direct reference to a process that eventually became
photolithography.

The initial projection, which has now boomed all the way to housing <cite>~2
**trillion** transistors on a **single die**[^1]</cite>!

A nod to [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling),
almost a decade before the seminal publication that would announce it!

Electronic design automation (EDA) would go on to become one of the biggest
industries. Modern EDA tools such as Quartus Prime do provide, in some sense,
direct schematic-to-realization capabilities. This has also manifested in other
important advances such as hardware description languages (HDLs), high-level
synthesis (HLS). The modern VLSI and ASIC industry would be nothing without EDA.
EDA plays a critical role in keeping the costs of today's ICs down by saving
huge amounts of money during the design and testing.

He's even got things right in the linear IC domain! Multi-stage amplifier ICs
are commonplace nowadays. Even radical applications such as _radar-on-chip_
(RoC) have not gone unnoticed. Tesla cars use RoCs for their navigation,
biomedical devices benefit from RoC, MIMO and other modern communication systems
use ICs as the backbone of their designs. They certainly have revolutionized
RADAR!

Although Moore's law has slowly started declining in the past few years, the
fact that it is still holding on for so long is in itself proof of the
expertise and vision Dr. Moore had in his field. It is an incredible insight
into how one must think in order to propel innovation.
