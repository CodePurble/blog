Hey! I'm your friendly neighbourhood tech enthusiast. My key competencies are
in VLSI, FPGA and ASIC design, and DSP. I also enjoy programming from
time-to-time. I'm an avid Linux and open-source enthusiast. Check out my
[dotfiles!](https://github.com/CodePurble/dots)

I seldom miss an opportunity to get out and play some football (or cricket? or
anything :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). Enjoy your visit!
